# Blocking User Tracking and Advertising Services
The purpose of this extension is to completely block advertising services and any sites that track you.

The difference between this service and adblock is that this extension prevents these sites from loading at their core, ensuring that no statistical data about you is accessible to these websites anymore.

If you have any website suggestions, please feel free to submit them [here](https://github.com/My-Google-Chrome-extensions/SiteBlocker-Extension/issues/new/choose).
